These terms apply to all Minecraft plugins developed under the SoneMC name. By downloading, installing, or using any of our plugins, you agree to follow the rules described below.

At SoneMC (the project), we use “we,” “our,” and “us” to represent the community rather than a team. Please note this project is run by a single individual.

We enjoy developing Minecraft plugins for public servers and provide them free of charge. However, anyone installing our plugins on a Minecraft server must understand that these plugins are not publicly tested on live servers with active players. Therefore, issues or errors may occur. If any problems arise on your server, you are responsible for any resulting damage. For this reason, plugins should be tested on a private or test server before being used publicly.

What you are ALLOWED to do:
- Download and use our plugins on private or public servers without the need to credit the author.
- Share the plugin with credit (links to the official plugin download page or website).

What you are NOT ALLOWED to do:
- Redistribute the plugins (for example, by uploading them to Spigot, GitHub, Mediafire, or similar platforms).
- Edit, decompile, modify, or reverse-engineer the plugin or its code in any way.
- Rename the plugin or claim it as your own work.
- Use modified versions of the plugin under any name.

Please note that these Terms of Use may change in the future. We will notify users about any updates on our official Discord server.
