        description: `Hey there! Welcome to SoneMC, where I'm trying to make plugins for every Minecraft server out there. My goal is to create plugins that are focused on fun, moderation and performance. I hope that you will find something useful here!

        Im trying to make those plugins as easy to use as possible and highly configurable at the same time. Every plugin is updated regularly to fix bugs and add new features. And of course, all plugins are updated so they work with newer Minecraft versions.
        If you have any questions, suggestions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me on Discord. I love hearing from the community and I'm always open to feedback!`,
